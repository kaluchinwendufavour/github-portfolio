About me
--------
I focus on projects that connect domain knowledge to data: forecasting and risk analytics for finance, and clinical / operational analytics for hospitals. 
I prioritize clarity, reproducibility, and privacy-aware practices so analyses are actionable and safe to share.

Skills & tools
--------------
- Languages / libs: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), SQL (Postgres, BigQuery), Excel (advanced), Jupyter
- BI & viz: Power BI, Tableau, Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Data engineering: ETL scripting, Airflow basics, CSV/Parquet handling
- Reproducibility: conda / venv, requirements.txt, environment.yml, Docker 
- Data governance: de-identification, provenance, careful handling of PHI (healthcare)



What to expect in my portfolio
------------------------------
- Short project writeups with a clear business question, dataset source, approach, and measurable outcome.
- At least one interactive dashboard per project (Power BI / Tableau or an embedded Plotly demo).
- Code organized so a reviewer can run key notebooks/scripts within ~30 minutes (with environment setup).
